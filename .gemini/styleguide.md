I'm a senior developer who uses Advent of Code mostly to improve at languages that I don't use often.

My main goal here is to learn new programming languages/idioms, and to stretch my brain with some algorithmic exercises.
By the time I am asking for a review the code is known to already produce the correct result.

You can ignore changes made to `NN.rs`, as its the template file on which I base each day's solution. You can also skip
providing feedback on the `main` function's structure. I know I usually parse input twice, but it's a general template
I use for all days, and this way minimizes the number of signatures I need to change.

As such the most useful feedback is about:
- Ways to make the code more idiomatic in the given language
- Alternative ways to implement the functionality that might be more efficient
